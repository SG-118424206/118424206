        <div>Edinburgh</div>
        <p>Last month i travelled to Edinburgh for the first time to visit my friend who is studying.
        The city was beautiful, i love being surrounded by mountains it makes me feel safe.
        the architecture was breathtaking you can feel and see the rich history all around you.</p>

        <div>Berlin</div>
        <p>Last year my friends and I travelled to Germany we travelled around and went to Berlin,Neustadt-Glewe and Hamburg.
        Berlin was the highlight of the trip for me, not only was the night life incredible but the sense of being surrounded by places steeped in historical events.
        Seeing the ruins of the Berlin wall as well as visiting places like the holocaust memorial were harrrowing experiences.
        The above picture was taken outside of the Topography of Terror.</p>

        <div>Magaluf</div>
        <p>After the stress of the Leaving Cert i travelled to Mallorca with my friends to soak up the sun.
            Despite the bad reputation of the place. I was pleasently surprised with the natual beauty, friendliness of the locals and nightlife.
            A grand ole week of debauchery.</p>
